This is a news app created using React Class based Component.

The app was created using a development API from newsapi.org (https://newsapi.org).

This is a simple project with no complex css or html so it does not look fancy.

Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com) was used for the styling and some npm packages like react-top-loading-bar(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-top-loading-bar) and react-infinite-scroll-component (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) have been used.

This project uses React Router which is why it cannot be deployed in GitHub
